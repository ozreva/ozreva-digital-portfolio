      <h2>Professional Journey</h2>
<p>
        Over the past two years, I have developed a strong passion for cybersecurity and enterprise IT infrastructures, earning an Associate’s degree in Information Technology as well as a Bachelor’s degree in Cybersecurity. With an increased interest in Active Directory security, network defense, and security operations, I have successfully completed numerous hands-on labs and projects designed to replicate real-world challenges encountered by organizations.
      </p>
      <p>
        My approach combines technical rigor with pragmatic solutions that balance security, usability, and operational feasibility.
      </p>

      <h2>Core Competencies</h2>
   <ul>
        <li>Active Directory Design, Hardening, and Audit</li>
        <li>Network Security: Firewalls, VLAN Segmentation, IDS/IPS deployment</li>
        <li>Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) and Log Analysis</li>
        <li>Threat Detection, Incident Response, and Attack Simulation</li>
        <li>Security Policy Development and Automation with Group Policy Objects</li>
        <li>Hands-on experience with pfSense, Suricata, Splunk, Kali Linux, Mimikatz, and more</li>

      <h2>Philosophy and Vision</h2>
 <p>
        I firmly believe cybersecurity is a continuous journey. Staying ahead of emerging threats requires persistent learning, hands-on practice, and a mindset of defense in depth. I am committed to leveraging technology and collaboration to build resilient systems that safeguard critical data and services.
      </p>

      <h2>Looking Forward</h2>
  <p>
        My goal is to contribute to innovative security initiatives within forward-thinking organizations by applying my skills in threat detection, network hardening, and security operations. I am eager to grow my expertise further and help build secure, scalable, and efficient technology environments.
