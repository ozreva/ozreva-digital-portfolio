      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Effective log management and event correlation are essential for detecting attacks, investigating incidents, and responding to threats in enterprise environments. To gain hands-on experience with these capabilities, I designed and implemented a <strong>SIEM and Log Analysis Lab</strong> built around <strong>Splunk Enterprise</strong>. This project emphasized log aggregation, normalization, correlation, and alerting across multiple operating systems and security devices.
      </p>
      <p>
        The lab showcased how centralized log analysis can be leveraged for faster detection and improved visibility of critical security events.
      </p>

      <h2>SIEM Deployment and Log Aggregation</h2>
      <p>
        The cornerstone of the lab was a deployment of <strong>Splunk Enterprise</strong> with <strong>Universal Forwarders</strong> installed on various endpoints and systems:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Windows systems</strong> forwarding Security, System, and Application Event Logs (including Sysmon).</li>
        <li><strong>Linux systems</strong> sending authentication and system logs.</li>
        <li><strong>pfSense firewall</strong> exporting traffic and security events.</li>
        <li><strong>Suricata IDS</strong> alerts for intrusion detection.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        This setup ensured that all logs from servers, endpoints, and network devices were centrally collected into Splunk for unified analysis.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why this was done:</em> Distributed logs without a centralized collection point complicate detection and make incident response slow and incomplete. Aggregation in Splunk simplified visibility and ensured no events were missed.
      </p>

      <h2>Log Normalization and Correlation</h2>
      <p>
        To enable meaningful analysis, I normalized events from heterogeneous sources:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Windows Event IDs</strong> and <strong>Sysmon</strong> telemetry for process execution and authentication trends.</li>
        <li><strong>Linux auth logs</strong> for privileged access and failed login attempts.</li>
        <li><strong>Suricata alerts</strong> for intrusion activity at the network layer.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Splunk’s ability to parse, normalize, and correlate events from different environments allowed me to build a unified security picture—connecting endpoint activity with network IDS alerts for comprehensive incident visibility.
      </p>

      <h2>Detection Dashboards and Correlation Rules</h2>
      <p>
        Inside Splunk, I designed <strong>custom dashboards</strong> for real-time monitoring and historical exploration of security events. Key correlation rules were developed to highlight:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Brute force attempts</strong> across SSH and RDP sessions.</li>
        <li><strong>Privilege escalation events</strong> detected in system logs.</li>
        <li><strong>Unusual network activity</strong> correlated with Suricata IDS alerts.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These dashboards provided an immediate view of the environment’s security posture while rules automated much of the detection workflow.
      </p>

      <h2>Attack Simulation and Alert Validation</h2>
      <p>
        To validate the effectiveness of the detections, I used a <strong>Kali Linux VM</strong> to launch simulated attacks, including:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>SSH brute force</strong> attempts against Linux servers.</li>
        <li><strong>RDP brute force</strong> attacks against Windows endpoints.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        These attempts were logged by the target systems, forwarded to Splunk, and correlated with Suricata alerts, triggering the expected detections in real time. This confirmed that the dashboards and detection rules were correctly tuned to identify hostile behavior.
      </p>

      <h2>Real-Time Alerting and Incident Response</h2>
      <p>
        Finally, I configured <strong>real-time alerts</strong> within Splunk for high-severity events such as repeated failed logins, privilege escalation, or simultaneous alerts across multiple systems. Alerts were delivered as notifications, ensuring timely response to simulated incidents.
      </p>
      <p>
        <em>Why this was done:</em> Detecting and logging suspicious behavior is important, but timely response is critical. Real-time alerts shorten the gap between detection and action, providing a significant improvement to incident response workflows.
      </p>

      <h2>Conclusion</h2>
      <p>
        The SIEM and Log Analysis Lab demonstrated how Splunk can be deployed in an enterprise-like environment to deliver deep visibility into security events across systems, endpoints, and networks. By aggregating, normalizing, and correlating logs, the lab mirrored best practices for real-world detection and response.
      </p>
      <p>
        Key outcomes included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Centralized <strong>log aggregation</strong> across Windows, Linux, firewalls, and IDS sensors.</li>
        <li>Consistent <strong>log normalization</strong> for improved correlation.</li>
        <li>Actionable <strong>detection dashboards</strong> and correlation rules for brute force, privilege abuse, and anomalous activity.</li>
        <li>Validation of defenses through <strong>attack simulations</strong>.</li>
        <li>Improved incident response with <strong>real-time alerting</strong>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The result was a fully integrated SIEM lab where detection, monitoring, and alerting worked together to improve visibility and readiness—skills directly applicable to enterprise security operations.
